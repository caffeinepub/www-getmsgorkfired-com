# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Create a simple voting website that asks users whether they support the CR and getting Ms.Gork fired, allowing them to vote yes or no and see the vote tallies.

**Planned changes:**
- Display the question "do you support the CR and getting Ms.Gork fired?" on a black background screen
- Add two voting buttons labeled "yes" and "no" below the question
- Store and persist vote counts in the backend for both yes and no responses
- Show the current vote counts after a user votes
- Design with bold, high-contrast visuals against the black background for dramatic impact

**User-visible outcome:** Users can view the voting question, click either yes or no to cast their vote, and immediately see how many people have voted for each option.
